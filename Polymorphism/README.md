## Polymorphism Notes
1. For Best Practise:
   ````
   1. Always Make compiler Work for you, How?
        1.1 To make it give errors that hint you
   2.To Apply That:
        2.1 Use word Final to avoid 
            override function You don't override
        2.2 Use override word in child to make compiler Know that you want to
             use this function which is inherited from parent
        2.3 Always Type word virtual If it's virtual, Don't depend on compiler  and to make code friendly to read
